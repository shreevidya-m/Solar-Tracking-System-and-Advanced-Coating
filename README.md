# Solar-Tracking-System-and-Advanced-Coating
This project combines two innovative approaches to enhance solar energy efficiency:
1. A **Solar Tracking System** that aligns solar panels dynamically to maximize sunlight exposure throughout the day.
2. **Advanced Solar Coating** technology aimed at increasing solar cell efficiency through specialized coatings.

## Features

- **Automated Solar Tracking**:Moves the solar panel to follow the sun's trajectory, ensuring maximum energy absorption.
- **Enhanced Coating**: Utilizes advanced coating methods to increase the effectiveness of solar panels.
- **Prototype and Simulation**: Includes a working prototype photograph and simulated analysis of coating effects.
